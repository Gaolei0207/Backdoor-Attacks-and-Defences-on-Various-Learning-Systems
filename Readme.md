This Github repository aims to trace the state of the art Backdoor Attacks and Defences on Various Learning Systemms. 

For more details and the categorization criteria, please refer to our survey.

We will try our best to collect all implementation codes and latest studies, and we will continuously maintain this Github Repository every week.

Motivation of this repository:
  1) The evolution direction of neural network backdoor attacks is constantly changing, as attackers seek new ways and techniques to bypass security measures and implement backdoor attacks on target systems.
  2) Studying new backdoor defense strategies is crucial to address the constantly evolving variants of backdoor attacks.

Here are some possible evolution directions of backdoor attacks：
1）Stealthiness
2) Persistency
3) 3) Targeting
4) Portability
5) Diversity of consequences（new）
6) Camouflage

Here are some possible evolution directions of backdoor Defences：
1）Backdoor prevention
2) Backdoor avoidance
3) Backdoor diagnosis
4) Backdoor erasing
